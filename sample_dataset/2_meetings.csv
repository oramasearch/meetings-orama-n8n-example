LongBeachCC_01072014_14-0024,14-0024,LongBeachCC_01072014,"Speaker 2: And 14 is communication from the Office of the Council Member. I lost the recommendation to direct the City Clerk to place an advisory question on the April eight, 2014 citywide election ballot, asking Long Beach voters Should the City of Long Beach allow the sale, use and possession of state approved fireworks within the city limits?
Speaker 1: Roslyn.
Speaker 9: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, I introduced this item for consideration of this body to put this on the April ballot. The Long Beach ban on fireworks originally went into effect in 1924, 90 years ago. And I would venture to say that the conditions of the city and the reasoning behind the ban are really unknown at this point
Speaker 9: . There have been several attempts to to discuss this matter and to deal with this matter as a city council over the last 90 years of believing 1960, 1970 and the last time this council addressed this issue was in the in the eighties, the last 4th of July received many complaints from residents, constituents who were complaining that the
Speaker 9: banned fireworks ban was not being adequately enforced in their neighborhoods. And that raised a lot of questions for me. Is that how do we really deal with this outside of. I don't believe we can really hire another, you know, thousand police officers to effectually deal with the issue.
Speaker 9: And so as I look more into the issue, we started realizing that every city surrounding Long Beach actually legally has legalized safe and sane fireworks. These these are fireworks stands that are strategic, I believe, strategically located in the ports of entry into our city.
Speaker 9: And they are being supported pretty heavily by Long Beach residents. Safe and sane fireworks that are and I will preface that these fireworks are legal in the state of California and they are approved by the state fire marshal as, quote, safe and sane.
Speaker 9: I also started thinking about the the benefits that that this conversation could have for our local nonprofits. As many of you know, my my children are involved in youth sports, and I sit on several different community based boards.
Speaker 9: And every organization in the city is struggling to make ends meet. Fundraising needs are tremendous. And the question was raised, well, why are we supporting a lot of these residents? Why are they supporting the youth organizations and the service organizations in other cities where we could actually be our organizations in this city could actually be benefiting from
Speaker 9: those dollars. And so I think it merits our attention. But more importantly, over the last 90 years or so, and every time that this issue has come before the city council, it's been the council making the decision. I know that this would be a robust conversation among the residents of the city of Long Beach, and I'm recommending
Speaker 9: that we put it before the voters on April. Well, it.
Speaker 1: A couple of things I want to hear from.
Speaker 9: I would love to hear from my colleagues on this matter.
Speaker 1: Well, when I hear from the fire chief or.
Speaker 4: Mayor Foust or council members, I thank you for the opportunity to briefly discuss this issue with you and express my professional concerns about making fireworks legal for sale, use and possession in the city of Long Beach, as was brought up in the 1960s.
Speaker 4: The state of California, under the direction of the state fire marshal and with pressure from the fireworks industry, enabled local municipalities the ability to approve for sale, use and possession state approved fireworks. These fireworks have been branded as safe and sane, but the slogan is far from the truth.
Speaker 4: In fact, it is important to note that the term safe and sane was created by the fireworks industry to give the impression of safety. The term is merely a marketing ploy, and the truth is that no fireworks or any other incendiary device are safe or sane.
Speaker 4: To illustrate my point, we all agree that we should not give matches to children to play with. In fact, the fire service across the nation has repeatedly educated school age children about the dangers of playing with matches. A lit match burns at 600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Speaker 4: A single lit match in the hands of a child or irresponsible adult can cause tremendous damage to property and to the health and well-being of people. To put this into perspective, a so-called safe and sane sparkler that are sold at corner fireworks stands when lit burns at 1600 to 1800 degrees.
Speaker 4: That's nearly three times slaughtered in a lit match. And as many of us know, a lit sparkler will continue to burn until the available fuel sources depleted in a situation that deteriorates from festive to dangerous. One cannot just blow out the flame.
Speaker 4: Light can be done with a match. In 2012, 9600 fireworks related injuries were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms. The trend in fireworks related injuries has been mostly in the range of 8500 to 9800 emergency room visits since 97, with the exception of spikes in 2000, which primarily coincides with the new millennium.
Speaker 4: One quarter, or 26% of the victims of fireworks injuries in 2012 were under the age of 15. In a typical year, the highest rates of injuries per million population applied to a wide range of age ages, including children age 5 to 19 and adults age 25 to 44.
Speaker 4: Males account for two thirds or 68% of fireworks related injuries. Three of five or 61% of the fireworks injuries in 2012 were to extremities such as the hand or finger, which accounted for 46% leg injuries, 11% arm, shoulder and wrist 4%.
Speaker 4: And most of the rest, or 34% of the total were two parts of the head, including the eye, which accounted for 17% of the total injuries in 2012. Eight out of nine or 89% of the emergency room visits for fireworks injuries involve fireworks that the federal government permit consumers to use.
Speaker 4: Sparklers, fountains and novelties alone accounted for one third or 34% of the emergency room fireworks visits fires involving fireworks. In 2012, an estimated 17,800 reported fires were started by fireworks. These fires resulted in an estimated 40 civilian injuries and $32 million in direct property damage.
Speaker 4: During 2007 to 2012, 91% of the average of 19,700 fires associated with fireworks per year occurred outside of a residence or vehicle. In 2007 to 2012, four people per year were killed by fireworks. While the data from death certificates show that five people per year were killed by will, killed directly by the fireworks themselves.
Speaker 4: Now, these estimates may overlap a little bit because fireworks can actually kill somebody and also start a fatal fire in 2000 or using 2000 to 2010 data. The risk of fire death relative to hours of usage is higher for fireworks than for Cigarets.
Speaker 4: Cigarets are often cited as a primary contributing factor to residential structure fires in the United States each year. But this data shows clearly that fireworks pose a greater threat than a lit cigaret in the promotion of fire on Independence Day.
Speaker 4: In a typical year, fireworks account for two out of every of all of five reported fires, more than any other cause. Also, in 2013, the National Fire Protection Association cited the increased use of safe and sane fireworks to create incendiary devices for domestic terrorism.
Speaker 4: One needs to look no further than the recent bombing in the Boston Marathon. The terrorists responsible for this horrific attack used fireworks purchased from an approved local vendor to create the bombs that caused so much damage and injury.
Speaker 4: Lastly, allowing the sale or use and possession of fireworks in Long Beach would lead to an increased stress on public safety resources as well as nearly every other city department. A recent experiment along these lines took place in the city of Huntington Beach.
Speaker 4: Two years ago, voters in Huntington Beach allowed for the sale use and possession of fireworks for a two year trial study. The trial study ended this past summer, and according to the fire chief in Huntington Beach, they were happy to see the ban go back into effect.
Speaker 4: The result of the trial in Huntington Beach was a significant increase in calls for service for both the fire and police departments, as well as significant impacts to public works department in cleaning up the debris left by the fireworks citywide, according to Chief Macintosh, the pilot program resulted in an inability of four firefighters or police officers to
Speaker 4: determine which fireworks were legal and which fireworks were illegal, making enforcement of applicable state law and municipal code nearly impossible. The chief stated that the city looked like a war zone for over a week and they're still feeling the effects.
Speaker 4: The chief believes that as a result of their experience over the past two years, the current ban will remain in effect in Huntington Beach for the foreseeable future. In our city, there are a number of readily accessible fireworks shows that members of our community can see during the Independence Day celebration.
Speaker 4: I would encourage residents to leave the fireworks displays up to the professionals and not put themselves their families, neighbors or property at risk of an unfortunate incident by a false security of using a device that has been branded safe and sane.
Speaker 4: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Any questions through the chief.
Speaker 3: So you're for it, then? You know.
Speaker 1: Hang on a sec. Hang on. Mr. Austin, you want to comment?
Speaker 9: Sure. I just had a couple of questions and. Well, you started your. And, Chief, I do appreciate the that the facts and the figures. And you're very honest, the editorial here, I don't expect didn't expect that you would be jumping over hoops to support this.
Speaker 9: It doesn't change the fact that access is pretty much unlimited. Any way to say the same fireworks to residents in Long Beach? The mere fact that every city surrounding Long Beach, Carson, Compton, Bellflower, Paramount, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens and Wall all recognize same for same fireworks is legal access.
Speaker 9: Is is is isn't really not the question here because our residents are buying these these fireworks. The marketing ploy that you have alluded to regarding safe and sane fireworks. Well, I'm looking at the California state code 12 599, which clearly has certain same fireworks time of sale.
Speaker 9: It's recognized by the California state legislature and by California law. And what is the does it work in surrounding communities? I'm not hearing about major issues in any surrounding cities where public safety or is being extremely stressed. I haven't heard any data from you to give us any any sense that we are using mutual aid to to
Speaker 9: address or respond to any of these other cities in their emergency needs during the 4th of July. And it just and understand your job is is public safety and to to to advise us and trust me, I'm taking your advice very seriously and under deep consideration.
Speaker 9: But at the same time, I think there's there's still something missing because it's all around us. And our residents have full access. Our police officers don't have and aren't really, I don't think, interested in really enforcing this. I think it's a public relations problem when, you know, our police officers are responding to a block party where you
Speaker 9: have a family lighting off, say, safe, and seeing fireworks and citing a family. But two blocks away, you know, they're laying off inmates and they're there there's there's it seems like the the the policy is really relatively discriminatory in terms of how we go about in arbitrary about where we we are we site and where we enforce
Speaker 9: the the fireworks ban or yeah, the fireworks ban altogether here in the city. So this, I think, is is something that that merits our discussion. And again, the question I guess I would have to you is, would you have a problem stating those points to the voters of Long Beach?
Speaker 9: You know, if this came before the ballot, these would be obviously great points to to consider for our voters to consider. The question is not whether or not fireworks are dangerous or or risky. I think that's pretty much known.
Speaker 9: I think that's the case. But but the question is whether or not the city of Long Beach should recognize safety, same fireworks as other cities around us do. I mean, all of them.
Speaker 1: Right. Let me let me just respond a couple of things, Mr. Dawson. First of all, the city of Los Angeles does not allow fireworks right now. So big cities, a lot of big cities don't allow it. And, you know, to me, if you want to allow it, just put an ordinance together.
Speaker 1: I don't want to waste money putting this on the ballot. How much does it cost to put these on the ballot?
Speaker 2: For two measures, we estimated about 135,000. You can split that in half depending on the pages of each.
Speaker 1: You know, if you if you if you if you really believe in it, put an audience together. But before the council, let them vote on it. I don't think this is something that merits going to a vote of the people.
Speaker 1: And secondly, you know, you can't even play dodgeball in school anymore because of the effect on children. Mr.. Mr.. NEILL With his, with all this stuff about healthy foods, people want to eliminate big, big gulp drinks, anything over 12 ounces.
Speaker 1: You've got a big program. And I applaud you for this. In the north area. Mr.. Neill to make sure kids eat healthy. But we're going to put a 1700 degree flame in their hands.
Speaker 3: You know, and see how fast they can run.
Speaker 1: This is kind of ridiculous. This isn't this is safe. This isn't safe. And it certainly is insane. It's insane. I understand. Wanting to raise money for non-profits. Mr. Ross and I got that. I mean, there's got to be better ways.
Speaker 1: That's all I would say. I just. I needed to say this. This is to me. I mean, if you believe in it, put it before the council.
Speaker 9: I'm glad you got that off your chest, Mr. Mayor. I like to hear from my colleagues.
Speaker 3: That Mr. Andrews.
Speaker 2: You know, really messed up know. So I feel like, you know, my major concern about, you know, allowing fireworks in our city limits would be a safe concern, especially in Long Beach is a much larger and divided city than any of the surrounding cities concerning, you know, currently allowing fireworks.
Speaker 2: And like I said, you know, we're looking at a situation, especially with our young kids today. And I know if you guys have been around on the 4th of July, not only the 4th of July, we have fireworks in our community all the time.
Speaker 2: And it's not just fireworks. So what we really have to be really careful because we do want to send our kids in the wrong direction. And I know we can raise money much better for these nonprofit organizations than, you know, putting an ordinance in, but, you know, opening up fireworks in our city.
Speaker 2: That, to me is a serious concern about the safety of our community and our children. Thank you.
Speaker 1: One other real difference between the cities around us. They're contract cities. They contract with the county for public safety services. You'll notice that the cities that have their own police, fire departments, they don't. Almost all of them banned this because they directly have to pay for it.
Speaker 1: It's almost a free good for the contract cities. Somebody else has to deal with it. Mr. Dillon.
Speaker 3: Thank you. Well, first of all, I'll second the motion, certainly, if we can vote on it. I do think it merits an up or down vote. I would I tell you that, Mr. Austin, that I think we should, you know, consider that maybe an ordinance might be a better approach than than the ballot, although I'm open to
Speaker 3: to either one for further discussion. But I could see some benefits in the ordinance. It can be in case it doesn't go as well as you hope. You know, it's very easy to undo an ordinance. It's not not so easy to undo something that's been voted on on the ballot.
Speaker 3: The one of the concerns that I do have that I think could be addressed in either approach, but I would want to make sure it is is clearly there are some places in the city that it would be inappropriate to do this.
Speaker 3: And I know just in the third place where I could support this, the peninsula is crazy enough on July 4th, adding anything to the peninsula I could not be supportive of. So I think there needs to be some mechanism to take a look at different locations in the city.
Speaker 3: And if it's an if it doesn't make sense to have these fireworks that we ought to be able to to zone it out, then the last thing I would say is that where there would be ordinance or ballot is we do need to have some kind of a revenue mechanism, because I do agree with Chief Tory that
Speaker 3: there is going to be some impact on public safety and we would need to make sure that we recoup those costs in advance from the folks that are selling these things. And we need to figure out what an appropriate price would be and then cover all our public safety costs.
Speaker 3: And if this public works cost of cleanup, we've got to cover those costs. So it should not cost the city anything to do this. But other than that, I'm certainly supportive of the conversation.
Speaker 1: Mr. Johnson.
Speaker 4: Well, thanks, Mayor. I guess my first question for the city clerk is, is tonight is the deadline for putting something on the April ballot, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Mr. Mayor and members of the council, yes. Tonight is the last council meeting, January 7th, prior to the statutory.
Speaker 3: Deadline of January 10th.
Speaker 4: Okay. And if I think one of my one of my concerns and I think Councilor Austin brings up a lot of good points and I hear your passion. So and I think you bring up a lot of good points.
Speaker 4: And certainly I've enjoyed fireworks as a young person and even as an older person. But I guess a city clerk, if we wanted to put this on the November ballot, that would be another option as well. Is that correct?
Speaker 2: You could, but I'm pretty sure it'll cost you quite a bit more because that would be consolidated. Oh, that's right.
Speaker 4: So but then I guess I misspoke. I meant that June election next June would be a possibility.
Speaker 2: It could be on the June as well. Okay.
Speaker 4: And the next question is for the police chief. You know, Chief, I think Councilor Austin has a good point, which is, you know, we certainly have gotten calls in the past from residents who are concerned with the current ban in the sense that they say, oh, you know, everyone's laying off fireworks.
Speaker 4: No one's do anything about it. And, you know, obviously, you have a lot of a lot of issues like crime issues. And certainly this may not be at the top of your list. So please comment on what's it like for the four P.D. on the 4th of July.
Speaker 4: And and how do you deal or how do we deal as a community with getting those calls and explain to people that we're not selectively enforcing our laws, that we're trying to be equal and typically not enforcing it in certain parts of town, anything like that, while at the same time recognizing, you know, your priority needs.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Thank you for the question. There is frustration on the part of the officers, as you can imagine, running from called to call for fire fireworks calls. Oftentimes, these calls will come out as a shots fired call. The officers end up responding.
Speaker 2: They're believing that it's something other than what it turns out to be. It's a relief when it turns out to be fireworks. However, they have to go, assuming that it's what the call said. So from a standpoint of of complacency, that becomes an issue for us on the backside.
Speaker 2: And looking at the number of calls for service, we anticipate that if safe and sane were sold in Long Beach, they would it would legitimize it in escalate the number of people lighting up fireworks. And while it would be legal, potentially, we still would get calls, annoyance calls, people lighting them off next door.
Speaker 2: They let them off to close to this or whatever, not because they have possession, but because of the noise as a disturbance to the person calling. So I anticipate that with a greater number of fireworks available in the city, we would have a greater number of radio calls to respond to as far as a priority, how they're
Speaker 2: handled. As I mentioned, there is frustration on the part of the officers and in some areas of the city were able to get a car out there and to be able to deal with it. But most frequently, by the time the officers respond, the fireworks have been lit off.
Speaker 2: The the people who let them off are gone and there's nothing but paper blowing and in the wind at the time. So it would be a workload issue from our standpoint. The fire chief laid out the safety issues and I won't go into that.
Speaker 2: But from our standpoint, much more of a workload issue.
Speaker 4: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Mr. Neal.
Speaker 2: Mr. Mayor, I actually appreciate the dialog and excuse me and my colleague bringing this for us to at least discuss and debate on on the validity of doing something like this. The conversation has kind of diverged into an idea, excuse me, in regards to an ordinance as opposed to a ballot initiative.
Speaker 2: And I don't want to speak for Mr. Austin, but I believe the question he was posing was to find out if if the citizenry was even interested in going in this direction, where of us doing an ordinance would give us some control.
Speaker 2: But it may be that the citizens themselves don't have a desire to to move in that direction. So there is validity both ways. I think the fact that we have to make a decision on this tonight, whether we're going to pursue the direction as as presented on the agenda or we make a decision to look at it
Speaker 2: as an ordinance would would definitely would buy some more time. It's something that we have to seriously consider, but I think it is a worthwhile discussion.
Speaker 1: Okay. Comes memberships.
Speaker 6: Or Mr.. You know the other alternative is to wait get a fuller report because I think before anything is rejected out of hand, I think it would be we haven't seen anything in writing and I've heard repeated stories about the problems in Huntington Beach and how they're very grateful that they've gotten the band off.
Speaker 6: But this still could go on if it was this sense of this council not to do an ordinance, but to go with the voters. It could go in June. I mean, it just seems like it's kind of last minute, last hour on something that has ramification in this city.
Speaker 6: You all are too young to remember. Had a horrible history with the bribing around fireworks because fireworks is big business. In fact, the councilperson for the sixth District went to jail over it and ruined a wonderful career that he had in the city.
Speaker 6: So my beaches had some bad history with fireworks and what it brings. So I would hope we at least have we're going to do this have a little bit more discussion then on the night of whether or not we're going to put it on the ballot or do an ordinance or whatever, give us some time so they
Speaker 6: can be looked at. That would be that would be my call. And I would.
Speaker 1: Just be the one.
Speaker 3: Mr.. Where would the costs be similar to do it on the June ballot?
Speaker 2: The cost would be similar provided that there's a June runoff, which you can decide whether or not there will be one or not.
Speaker 6: Is is the pope Catholic?
Speaker 3: Well, I think the mayor's race will be one out rape and the third district, there'll probably be a runoff.
Speaker 2: So what will be the deadline.
Speaker 9: For the June ballot?
Speaker 2: If I recall, it would be 88 days before June 8th. April 8th is 56 days. So somewhere around some around the end of March.
Speaker 3: Well, two months from now. Right. Because April to June goes back, two months of this date would be moved back two months.
Speaker 9: So would you guys be open to changing this motion to to to put in an advisory vote before the voters in June?
Speaker 2: Well, the strategy is analyze the potential revenues would be.
Speaker 3: The interview. Well, I'm certainly open to that. But but if we have almost two months, is there any more information that we can get? Can we have a suggestion for staff on what the fees ought to be and how much revenue we would need to generate?
Speaker 3: Could we could we get any additional information on any problems and maybe no problems for Lakewood in the surrounding cities that you mentioned? Is there an opportunity to collect a little more information? But but I'm fine with heading in that direction.
Speaker 3: And then one clarification is so would the ballot item be that the citizens would vote whether or not to give the council direction to then go develop an ordinance to basically.
Speaker 9: Yes, it's that. It's an advisory question of shall we? Shall we not? Yes or no? If the majority of voters says yes, that gives the council direction to to then start crafting an ordinance. And I mean, this is just square one right now, to be quite honest with you.
Speaker 3: Okay. So I mean, if if I guess if truly, our our worst case scenario is that we spend $65,000 and the citizens vote no. All right. Well, I would like to have a little more information if possible, but I think shooting for the June ballot, I certainly feel more comfortable with an April.
Speaker 1: Mr. Parker.
Speaker 4: You may remember the City Council as proposed by Council member Austin. The advisory vote would be non-binding on the council, of course, so they could come back, and if the citizens were inclined to favor fireworks, the council would still be free to decline or not to adopt an ordinance.
Speaker 1: But cancel memberships keep. All right. We have any public comment on this. Any member of the public. Please identify yourself.
Speaker 7: Dennis Dunne. Let the kids have some fun. Fireworks are fun. I enjoyed them. My family supervised it and loved to see the smile on my face as I burned down a little cabin without sparkling. So the chief is grasping at straws, is particularly noted when he says, I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 7: Domestic terrorism is caused by fireworks. It's inspiration in that direction. I think that possibly maybe we should ban turkeys because we might get burned face Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: It's why you can't play dodgeball. You might get hit in the head.
Speaker 5: Can we put.
Speaker 6: That on the agenda next week, please?
Speaker 1: All right. We have any.
Speaker 3: Mr. Mayor. Well, Mr. Mayor.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 5: This is actually what I came down for and waited all this time, so. Yes. Good evening again. I drove through Lakewood where fireworks are allowed on July 4th last year. It was an absolute war zone. The air was thick with smoke, dogs barking relentlessly.
Speaker 5: Many of the streets were filled with people shooting off large fireworks in the aftermath. The streets and parks were absolutely littered with spent rockets and other trash. Our resources are already stretched to the max, according to public safety sources.
Speaker 5: How many fires will be started? How many homes destroyed? How many injuries will require paramedics? How many asthmatic will experience life threatening breathing problems because of the gross air pollution? How many parents will be frightened or harmed? How many irresponsible people will cause damage to their neighbors property?
Speaker 5: Who will be available to handle these situations? Are the groups that would profit from the sale of these fireworks going to pay for all these extra expenses of the city for public safety? Will they pay for the damages to property?
Speaker 5: How do they plan to atone for the loss of a child die or the heartbreak of losing a pet, or even the loss of somebody's life in a fire? Will they be cleaning up all the trash that's left behind, or are they willing to shoulder this responsibility?
Speaker 5: The state is experiencing one of the most one of the worst droughts in history, a powder keg for wildfire. A single burning ember can travel the distance of a mile. Don't we have enough of a mess? From the Queen Mary.
Speaker 5: Fireworks, visitors without adding more problems. All things considered, the city council needs to put this issue to bed and continue the ban. It's the only safe and sane thing to do. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And excuse.
Speaker 2: Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council staff. My name is John Kelly, Vice President, TNT Fireworks. 555 North Gilbert Street in Fullerton. As you consider your decision this evening on 14, I'm here to provide you with a brief snapshot of the fireworks industry in California and in L.A. County.
Speaker 2: Of the 46 states that currently allow consumer fireworks, the most restrictive state law is, yes, California. Safe and sane, as defined in the California Health and Safety Code, have been legal in California. The elders in my tribe told me since the forties.
Speaker 2: So we are the toes, the forties and all kinds of numbers. Take your pick. All products are tested and approved by the California State Fire Marshal before they can be sold. They may not explode, fly into the air or dart uncontrollably on the ground.
Speaker 2: They must perform under a ten feet, ten foot height restriction, and six foot circumference are limited to under 500 grams of composition and are subject to strict packaging and transportation guidelines. State law allows them to be sold used to possess from June 28th, noon to July the sixth.
Speaker 2: It's important to understand the difference between safe and sane versus illegal or dangerous fireworks. Again, as defined in the California Health and Safety Code, once approved authority transfers to local jurisdictions to allow their sale and use within their borders.
Speaker 2: It is an opt in system. It's up to the city to craft the ordinance, set criteria for and issue the permits, set fees and administer the program. Currently, there are three 270 communities that allow the sale of state approved fireworks in California, 63 of them in Southern California, throughout Ventura, L.A., Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties
Speaker 2: . 39 sell here in L.A. County. TNT is a wholesale distributor to 2500 nonprofit organizations statewide who sell these products as a fundraiser for the 4th of July. Most of the nonprofits are youth organizations, high school athletics, Pop Warner, Little League, church groups of all denominations, and finally service philanthropic and veteran organizations.
Speaker 2: Many rely on firework sales as a majority of the revenue for their programs. The past five years, there's been significant activity among cities bringing back fireworks in the state of California. Most recently, voters in Fullerton approved the overturn of a ban from fireworks from 1990.
Speaker 2: Westminster voters did the same in 2010. Villa Park, Brawley. Calexico, Stockton. Tracy, Lodi, Salinas, West Sacramento and Dixon all opened in the past five years. We know there are challenges in education, administration and public safety when it comes to a fireworks discussion.
Speaker 2: There are existing ordinances in Southern California that can and do address those concerns. Want to comment? A couple of comments made. We're not talking about toys here. State law prohibits the sale to anyone under 16 years of age.
Speaker 2: Most cities have adopted 18 year old wire. Of course, sparklers have been banned in California since 1993. Injury statistics quoted earlier include all fireworks, which includes full CE, which are not available in California. Voters did not approve fireworks.
Speaker 2: And on Extra Beach, that was a council action by a vote of 5 to 2. There was a change in the council majority during the second year of that, and that council voted 4 to 3 not to continue fireworks.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Any other comments?
Speaker 7: Celebration of a great American revolution should be encouraged. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Speaker 2: Good evening, Eddie Rozell. As I look at 3509 Lewis Avenue in the seventh District, I want to thank Mr. Austin for bringing this thing up. I've been in the city of Long Beach for 39 years, and those 39 years I've been criminalized every July 4th because I'm one of those people that buy fireworks.
Speaker 2: I would say to everybody, please consider this. The gentleman just spoke right now, if his numbers are true, people want this. And why should I be spending money in Lakewood or in Bellflower when I could be spending it here in Long Beach?
Speaker 2: Now, I respect everything that our esteemed police chief and fire chief have said about this, but it is like the gentleman just said, it is a traditional thing. And again, before you dismissal of this thing, I think what Mr. Austin has brought up is very valid, a very good issue that should be brought up, like I said
Speaker 2: , 39 years and Long Beach and 39 years criminalized. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: Very good. Good. You? The clerk has the address. With all due respect, the book. I think that this motion is a prima facie case. Against the second hand smoke of marijuana is obviously. Unchecked in the gentleman's district. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Johnson?
Speaker 4: Well, it's hard to top that, Mayor, but I guess I want some clarification. But I think we've had some pretty good conversation. And my point of view is, I think, you know, I appreciate the councilor also bring this up.
Speaker 4: I think it is worthy of kind of robust conversation. Hearing the pros and cons, I'm not really eager to put on the April ballot. I think we just heard about it tonight, but I am interested in talking about it more.
Speaker 4: So is is the consensus that we're saying that we're going to hear more from staff, get some reports, think about it, and then consider whether it put on the June ballot or actually sign up tonight. Put on the June ballot.
Speaker 4: I, I wanted to say on the motion.
Speaker 1: Remote motion is still to put it on an April ballot. Oh, but he may change it.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, I guess.
Speaker 4: I'll ask both. Councilor, also, what do you think about perhaps take some time, maybe ask his staff to come back with the full report canvasing power station. Then we can come back at a future meeting with that.
Speaker 2: Maybe meets their needs or.
Speaker 9: We can have a report within 30 days. I think, you know, I would definitely be open to a friendly amendment to moving it to the June ballot ballot with four, but with having a lot more information from from staff in terms of what what the the cost will be, what type of potential revenues we could be looking
Speaker 9: at getting here. Is it worth it necessarily to pursue this from a from a fiscal standpoint? And we also have to address the the the cost of public safety. And and moving forward with this, we would have to definitely have to, I think, compensate for that.
Speaker 9: So I'm open to an amendment to do that.
Speaker 3: To make sure that that'll be my friendly amendment.
Speaker 1: Let's be clear what exactly the amendment is. The amendment, as I understand it, from what I heard, is to to ask for a report from staff on the items that were enumerated within 30 days, and that at that point, we would consider whether or not it would be put on the June ballot.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Not making the June decision tonight, but waiting for the information, which seems appropriate. Okay, that's the motion.
Speaker 2: Mr. Mayor. Okay, Mr. Mayor.
Speaker 1: Members, cast your votes.
Speaker 4: Well, the city clerk has, quote.
Speaker 2: The deadline for the June election would be March.
Speaker 1: Seven. Okay. So we'll be having before March 7th. 30 days would be early February.
Speaker 3: That sounds familiar. Somebody said two months from today.
Speaker 2: This motion carries nine votes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now we go to item 15 luxury.","Recommendation to direct City Clerk to place an advisory question on the April 8, 2014 citywide election ballot asking Long Beach voters:  ""Should the City of Long Beach allow the sale, use and possession of state approved fireworks within the city limits?""; and request the Office of the Mayor to designate persons, or associations of persons, to write arguments either for or against or both for and against the approval of the advisory question placed on the ballot.",2014-01-07

Speaker 5: Yes, Madam President. I move the council to a95 will be placed upon final consideration and do pass.
Speaker 1: It has been moved and seconded. I will open the public hearing and ask for the staff report.
Speaker 8: I'm back. David is with community planning development here, this time with 61st and tenure. A stationary plan up for adoption. Tonight, just to give everybody a little context of where we're at and why we're doing a stationary plan out in the gateway.
Speaker 8: The East commuter rail line is scheduled to open up in early 2016, and the initial environmental document that RTD produced did not include a gateway station. Since that time, the city negotiated with RTD to return one of the gateway stations that were initially, you know, conceived back into an environmental document with that idea, released a request for
Speaker 8: proposals for an aviation station in the Gateway in 2012, and the 61st pumping station advanced as the station of choice. This is in the east corridor. Mayor likes to call it the quarter of opportunity. So a quarter that has an opportunity to connect a lot of existing neighborhoods and future residential and and job opportunities with existing job
Speaker 8: centers connecting downtown in Union Station with DIA and also the Anschutz Medical Campus is just one stop away in the 2025 line out of our existing plan, say about 60% Panya Generally speaking, they really don't acknowledge a station area or a rail station at 60 versus Panya, so there's not a lot of plan support for the type
Speaker 8: of two D development, a transit oriented element that we'd like to see at this location. The planning process with the station area plan is been parallel track almost with a general development plan that will be approved hopefully in the near term here in 2014.
Speaker 8: And then later this year, an official zone map amendment will come back in front of council to rezone this property. The plan concepts that are present to you tonight have. Detailed input from the four major property owners within the station area, as well as input and review from multiple city departments.
Speaker 8: We did have a joint city and RTD public meeting in July that was well attended out of the Green Valley Ranch Rec Center, as well as an additional public meeting this November. The location here is bordered on the west by Panther Boulevard, north of Future 64th Avenue East, the existing Tower Road, and to the South 56th Avenue
Speaker 8: . As you probably know, there's nothing really out there right now. And just to give you context, that 382 acres that are in the station area plan overlaid over downtown would really encapsulate the entire downtown area. So it's a very large area which will require multiple phases over a long period of time for for a full buildout.
Speaker 8: With all our stationary plans, where I always establish a vision and key principles and what we say here about 60% Panya is that the station will serve as a vibrant, compact urban center for the regional aerotropolis. A world class, transit oriented community catalyzes development and connects people.
Speaker 8: And four key ideas that we take out of that vision statement is that it's going to be a transit community, which is something that Rocky has been pushing as a term that we're gradually graduating to, that it will be well connected, it will be a vibrant, compact, urban place, and that will be catalyzing development, sustainable development in
Speaker 8: the Gateway area. That strategy framework, we take those four key ideas and do our plan recommendations based off of those categories. I'll run through those relatively quickly in the transit community section. We focus on the next few uses.
Speaker 8: The big idea here is that the Transit Orange development is near the station. It's the most intense development pattern and inside the the Telluride Loop, which is this new arterial that will go into place to the east of Telluride, is two mixed use areas, one focused on employment to the north, one focus on residential to the south
Speaker 8: , and then along tower and 56, a little more arrow oriented land uses with the commercial corridor in a town center. In combination, we have recommendations on the scale of development. Again, we're focusing on the taller buildings with higher densities near the station.
Speaker 8: The purple in the map you see there is up to 12 stories in heights. The light blue is eight and the yellow farther away from the station is five. This Building Heights map promotes a very building height throughout the station, trying to focus on the view corridors and and a good scale for development throughout the entire area
Speaker 8: . We have recommendations to preserve those front range views through the open space corridors and key rights of way and as well as recommendations on the transitioning from those higher density areas closer to the station to the lower density, more residential areas further away.
Speaker 8: Our connected section focuses on the mobility aspects of the plan as a sort of blueprint a Denver Street classification map. I'll run through a few street cross sections after this, but the two key ideas here again to look at is Telluride, which would be a new arterial street that would cut through the stationary north to south and
Speaker 8: have this larger loop. This is a concept that the stakeholders in their proposal presented as a way to increase the pedestrian oriented area of the TOD. Moving a busy arterial farther away from the rail station itself. And then the Key Street here is a local main street aviation place, which is almost like a festival street for the
Speaker 8: for for the community. That's what's illustrated right here, actually. See, there's two lanes of traffic, but on three parking, very wide, generous pedestrian zones. Three trees to two blocks to reach that connects the transit station to an urban park and could function as a place for community gathering and the like.
Speaker 8: Telluride The major, major arterial, has a very wide 50 foot green space in the middle kind of a park parkway type design also allows a necessary gas pipeline to to cut through that area. We have mixed use collector 62 avenue here shows the bike lanes on 60th as well as Salinas and other mixed use collector without the
Speaker 8: bike lanes again relatively local streets with wide pedestrian zones. We also have recommendations talking about how to connect. To the rest of the gateway and beyond. The key here is the regional bike connections. First Creek. The bottom left of the map.
Speaker 8: There's a major open space corridor that while the bike path which already is actually being designed and built and that connects down to Green Valley Ranch as well as the wildlife refuge, which is just to the west of Panama of the blue game.
Speaker 8: A drive to the north is another open space bike path as well as local on street bike facilities on Yampa in 60th. And also a facility that connects the two regional bike paths to the station running along the transit corridor.
Speaker 8: That's a key recommendation that we added at Ludy was a recommendation to really make sure that we're examining all future bicycle facility types. That facility, there could be a bike path or but it also could be a cycle track or other enhanced bicycle facility when it's developed.
Speaker 8: A parking management's. Another recommendation that we have focused on having a strategic approach to parking here will be critical. The station has kind of a unique situation of being a interline station for commuters that are wanting to reach downtown or other job centers, but also accommodate parking for people trying to get to DIA, as well as the
Speaker 8: phased development approach that is necessary to transition from surface parking to structure. So we'll be working with the stakeholders to figure out a parking plan here at the Transit Plaza, another key urban space right next to the transit station and is kind of the gateway to the station area.
Speaker 8: We have urban design recommendations, including active edges and building frontages. The active edges are read on this map and building frontages are the blue. I really focus on Aviation Place and Aviation Park. I also have recommendations on appropriate block sizes and implementing design standards and guidelines as we move forward with development and then our vibrant catalyze concepts
Speaker 8: . This map kind of show the Open Space Network. I've already mentioned First Creek as a major open space corridor as well as blue a draw from a neighborhood park perspective. There's a five acre neighborhood park just north of First Creek, as well as, I believe, about two acre parks embedded within the mixed use neighborhoods east of Telluride
Speaker 8: . The key urban open space is right in the center of the map. That's Aviation Park. And again, that's an opportunity for a community gathering place. You can see that at the bottom of the screen here. I think you could imagine it's similar to the open space at 49th Avenue Town Center.
Speaker 8: We have a recommendation of three states excluding streetscapes. And finally, with the catalyze section, we do have recommendations on economic development. Speaking of of how this is a kind of a jumpstart for our development in the kind of regional aerotropolis and setting the stage for this sustainable development pattern.
Speaker 8: And that's more pedestrian friendly, multi-modal in nature. We also have recommendations on the jobs and housing balance, the plans that are being done in isolation. And of course, there's other planning efforts along these corridor, including Dr. COGS Assist Corridor Initiative.
Speaker 8: So as development starts to occur here, we'll be working with the Stakeholders Development Team to make sure that we're trying to capitalize on existing partnerships with local, affordable housing advocates and providers to take advantage of those opportunities. Because I think they share the city's viewpoint that having a diverse mix of housing types is essential for this project
Speaker 8: to be a success. But that the planning board did see this in November. They did find that it was consistent with all of our adopt plans. There was an inclusive public process. I mentioned this through public meetings even.
Speaker 8: There's no one living here. We actually probably had over 50 people attend those meetings. The Wild Horse Ranch Condo Association just east of Tower, they were very active in those meetings. And there's a long term view for the station area of the 20 year plan horizon.
Speaker 8: But since it's a pretty fluid development area that we'll be looking to review the plan before that and make sure it's still applicable. And our requested action tonight is that you consider adopting this point of supplement to the Denver Comprehensive Plan.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. We have four people signed up to speak. I'm going to ask you to come up to the front pew, Dan Charamba, Rick Wells, bird bells and say coo. Please come up to the front pew and I'll call on Dan Paramo to to the podium.
Speaker 3: Madam President. Council members. I'm Dan Caramba, the managing director of Airport City Development at DIA. And I'm just here to affirm that DIA has been heavily involved in what the other three property owners in the creation of this plan.
Speaker 3: And we have worked very closely with community planning and development on it. We strongly support a plan. We look forward to the next steps, the general development plan and the zoning. And I think those concepts will be consistent with what you've seen here tonight, and we've enjoyed working with our fellow stakeholders on this.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much, Mr. Trevor.
Speaker 3: Rick Wells My name is Rick Wells. I'm here to be available to answer any questions by the council, if any come up that I can help with. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Wells, for Bell's.
Speaker 3: Good timing. Third Bells 11 2517 Street, Denver, Colorado and Happy New Year. I am representing all the other landowners besides DIA and we have 382 acres and it's a pretty massive development, but we're excited about it. I want to say that everyone's worked very hard on this and we spent a lot of time.
Speaker 3: It's hard to craft a plan from a wheat field, but the opportunity with the rail stop and DIA in the city picking us to have that rail stop has created this opportunity. We see this as a great plan.
Speaker 3: We think it'll be a great development. I think it will be a catalyst for the region. And we really believe that it will allow development to coalesce around this site and really become kind of a community center for out there.
Speaker 3: We've reached out to many of the surrounding neighborhood groups and the developments around. They're all excited about it and we're excited about it and we ask for your support. I would like to thank CPD for their vision and their tireless effort.
Speaker 3: There's a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things to consider, and they've been open throughout the process to all of our thoughts and they've done a great job. So thank you very much. And I'm available for questions.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Bell's Sekou.
Speaker 7: Sacred Black are action movement for self-defense representing poor.
Speaker 2: Working, poor homeless people.
Speaker 7: I'm reminded of the words of Frederick Douglass abolitionist, who said that the slave starts being the slave when he says no. And many times we become slave of old habits that are institutionalized in government, where it's more convenient to go along with the status quo in what appears to be good for the majority of the people, when
Speaker 7: in fact for those that are going to be adversely affected, are not considered. And so here we go, stamp this area plan being a part of a larger plan called the comprehensive plan for the city and county of Denver.
Speaker 7: With most of us sitting up here have never read page by page and have not even read this page plan page by page. We've given some kind of summary thing from the planning quote, and the devil's in the details.
Speaker 7: But I'm telling you, we read the plan and we read this plan, and you see that white only, white only because all of the people are going to build it. Those people are going to make the money off of it.
Speaker 7: Those are the people going to occupy the land. And do you remember last year when somebody came in here and created ten metropolitan districts on 300 acres out there? Maybe I'm just crazy, but it doesn't. Ain't this it?
Speaker 7: Now, here we go. Here comes the details. Step one. Step two. Step three. Step four. And now we go to segregated town all over again. In the 21st century. And we participated in it consciously because we refused to say no, no more.
Speaker 7: This is done. So tonight I ask you, in the spirit of Douglas Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So we can get on with it, too, right? Liberation of the city.
Speaker 7: So it becomes a city for everybody. And not just a city for white only. And now white only for rich. White only. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay. That ends our speakers. Are there questions from council and. Oh, Councilwoman Ortega.
Speaker 6: I'm not sure who to direct this to, but I wanted to ask about. I understand. You know what we're doing here. But I want to know what kind of conversations are going on with regard to affordable housing as one of the values that is being talked about for the development out here.
Speaker 6: And I understand that at one point we had one area where the LDA noise contour was, and that's been shifted a little bit and it will allow rental housing to exist. So can you speak to both of those points?
Speaker 8: The the existing overlay that is in place allows my multi-family up to 60 seconds but not north of 62nd and does not allow a single family north of 56 in this area. And that overlay still exists. And the plan was written to to be able to be an effective plan, whether that regulation stays in place or is
Speaker 8: changed at a future date with the land use and building heights concepts. So I think that might answer your second question. The first question about what what I guess, what how does the plan speak to affordable housing? Correct.
Speaker 8: Is. I think twofold. You know, I think it tries to address affordable housing at this micro level in the station area. Speaking to the opportunities to work with local affordable housing providers, we have a unique opportunity here having writing a stationary plan with a development team that will be actively pursuing it to build out here, and we'll
Speaker 8: have opportunities to to make those partnerships happen. And then also, I think from the macro level, we have to look at how that works within a citywide policy discussion about, you know, affordable housing throughout Denver.
Speaker 6: Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman and Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for your question. I appreciated seeing this in there. And I also appreciate that this team has actually been willing to spend some time exploring different options and meeting with different experts.
Speaker 1: And so I do hope that that all comes to fruition. My question was actually a little bit broader, which is when we originally put out the RFP, when DIA put out the RFP, I appreciated that they took some input from council on thinking about connectivity to existing neighborhoods and which station, you know, might provide more of that
Speaker 1: . I was just curious whether any ideas emerged that anyone wants to share. I mean, we I feel like we learned some lessons with the Stapleton project where, you know, I don't think that Northeast Park Health feels as connected to Stapleton as we would might like.
Speaker 1: Quebec has turned out to be quite a barrier and just hasn't been as seamless of old and new. And it's kind of hard to refer to Green Valley Ranch as an old neighborhood, but in this case it will be the older the older cousin, if not the uncle, to this neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And so I was just curious if any ideas emerged that are in this plan to really have more connectivity between existing and new. And they may not be like written in stone, but just did that conversation go anywhere?
Speaker 8: I think there's two concepts, especially from a North-South perspective. One is the the regional bike trail that's going to be actually happening on First Creek. So that's a real opportunity to actually have a real legitimate, very high ease of use, bicycle facility connecting Green Valley Ranch up to the station area as well and into the wildlife refuge
Speaker 8: and also Yampa or excuse me, Telluride as a mixed use arterial. So not just a commercial arterial that's just moving people through. But if we build Telluride the right way here in the station area, as it would then extend south and north for that network and particularly south.
Speaker 8: That could be a really great street that's, you know, serves multiple modes of transportation and it does connect to the high school that's in Green Valley Ranch. So I think from those two perspectives, we also have recommendations, you know, on Tower Road on and how that eventually gets built out and and is done in a way that
Speaker 8: isn't a barrier in that the town center land use designation around 16/61 is kind of a gateway into the station area, can serve as a kind of a a neighborhood center that everybody in the gateway can access.
Speaker 1: So thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Kennish. I see no other questions, so I'm going to close. One more.
Speaker 6: I just have one more. All right. And this is for the city attorney. David, can you just tell us? Whether all of the proposed uses that are on any portion of the desert land that makes up part of these 300 acres is in conformity with the idea.
Speaker 3: I might ask Dan to comment on this, but I it's my understanding that the only portion of what you've seen depicted on these maps as affected by the IGA is directly adjacent to where the platform is, where the transit stop would be.
Speaker 3: And there are were special provisions made originally in 1988 along the transportation quarter there to have a greater diversity of land use from the get go. And Dan, would you confirm if that land is in the transportation corridor area or what what's your familiarity is with this issue?
Speaker 3: We've we've looked at the uses relative to the idea. And generally this land since is south of 72nd is is has relatively minor is relatively minor impacts from the. Generally speaking, all of the uses are consistent. We believe this these entitlements are entirely consistent with the idea.
Speaker 6: And is that particularly because they are on one of the transit corridors?
Speaker 3: It's because it's addressed in the ACA. The transit corridor is addressed both the transit corridor and the land within the transit corridor that is south of 72nd Avenue, which is a very.
Speaker 8: Significant boundary within that agreement.
Speaker 6: Thank you very much.
Speaker 3: And if I could add, Madam President, the something else to to be said about this is that most of what you see beyond the platform is all private property. And some of the land use restrictions that that that existed in the IJA were only on city property that's under the jurisdiction of the manager of aviation.
Speaker 3: So when we annexed this major portion of land from Adams County in 1988, it did include some private properties that just are free to be developed. There were no lands in land use restrictions as applied to the private property portions of the annexation, as contrasted with the property that's owned and under the management of the manager of
Speaker 3: aviation.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Premiere. Thank you, Mr. Bradwell. I see no other questions. So now I will close the hearing and ask for comments. Councilman Herndon.
Speaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. As, as first said, one of the speakers, you know, it's difficult to create a station from a wheat field. And I would second that and even say it's difficult to create a station from a wheat field when you have multiple landowners and then you take into account what's important as a city.
Speaker 5: When we develop a station as well, and I have been a part of all these dialogs for a very long time since being elected. And I just want to commend you all.
Speaker 3: For.
Speaker 5: What this project that you are putting together and hearing the interest of councilmembers at the last land use meeting when there were some quiet concerns and questions about bike lanes. And I want to thank David and his team as well for incorporating incorporating as well, because we've taken a lot of time into putting together a product that
Speaker 5: I think fits everyone's needs. Very excited to see this begin to move forward. I think it was a great and the right decision to make in choosing this station first and looking forward to future stations being built, that one close to the air and also preserving those view, those beautiful views that we have on the mountain, on
Speaker 5: the far northeast. And it was a great community input that was received during this. So I'm very supportive of this and certainly hope that my colleagues will support it as well.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Herndon and Councilman Shep Shepherd. Thank you, Madam President. I promised further I would have a robust dialog going on on bike issues, so I don't want to disappoint you, for know. So when this item came to committee, we had a pretty robust discussion over two sessions regarding the whole bike lanes and potentially protected bike
Speaker 1: lanes, usage of the site and council. President Susman and I were quite adamant at the time that if we were, you know, creating this community from scratch, you know, and there wasn't any of the right away restrictions that we often experience in other parts of town as we are trying to plan and build for the future.
Speaker 1: Why shouldn't we? From the bat, you know, include these protected bike lanes because we know that they're in such high demand across the city and across the country. And that led to a really informative discussion with public works that helped educate us on when exactly protected bike lanes specifically might be warranted based on traffic counts and speeds
Speaker 1: and safety issues in certain corridors. And I think that was a really good discussion and very eye opening. But I do want to thank CPD for listening to that discussion and for, you know, in between the first and second time that it came to committee to incorporating additional language, you know, into the plan about how we might
Speaker 1: address these issues going forward. But finally, you know, one of the things that I brought up was around implementation. And, you know, this we have many gorgeous plans sitting on shelves across the city. And I guess one of my concerns is that, you know, there's a bit of a disconnect between, you know, what ends up getting implemented
Speaker 1: in, you know, things getting lost in translation between the planning process and about what actually ends up on the ground as these communities are being planned. And I just want to take this moment to re-emphasize that, you know, I really hope that the opportunity to, you know, really focus on moving people as opposed to cars at this
Speaker 1: incredible site is is a great focus. CBT You've acknowledged that, but I hope public works, you know, takes that you know the full step going forward and I just really want to emphasize that that we don't want to squander those opportunities to really make this a multi-modal city as we do plan out these incredible opportunity sites, especially
Speaker 1: when we are starting from scratch. So, you know, this is my hope that things don't get lost in translation in between planning and implementation. And again, I do want to thank you for including some specific language in the plan around that.
Speaker 1: And I just want to send a message to public works that this is a huge priority, as they well know for myself and this body. So thank you. And I am supporting the plan. Thank you, Councilwoman Shepherd. Well said.
Speaker 1: Are there any other comments? I see none. So let's go ahead and do that. Roll call. Herndon I can eat lemon. Lopez All right. Montero I love it. I. Ortega Hi, Rob. Shepherd Hi. Brooks Hi. Madam President. Hi, Madam Secretary.
Speaker 1: Close the vote and close the. What is it? Let's have the count of the vote. Oh, my word of advice. 12 I civil faces. Congratulations, Councilman Herndon. Now I have no pre adjournment announcements, therefore seeing no business before no other business for this body.
